Welcome to my data science portfolio project focusing on the dynamic realm of New York real estate. In this endeavor, I embark on a journey to unlock insights, reveal trends, and predict housing prices in one of the world's most vibrant and diverse real estate markets.

This project showcases my proficiency in data cleaning, visualization, and predictive modeling. Beginning with meticulous data cleaning, I sift through the dataset, removing inconsistencies to ensure robust analysis. Armed with a clean dataset, I employ powerful visualization techniques to unveil intricate relationships between price and various factors such as area, location, and neighborhood. Through visually compelling graphs and interactive plots, I decipher patterns and unearth valuable insights that drive informed decision-making.

But the journey doesn't end there. Leveraging machine learning algorithms, I delve into predictive modeling, aiming to forecast housing prices with precision. By exploring relationships between price and key predictors such as area, location, and neighborhood characteristics, I provide actionable insights for both homebuyers and real estate professionals navigating the bustling world of urban housing.

Join me as I unravel the mysteries of New York real estate, blending data science expertise with domain knowledge to illuminate the path towards informed decision-making in urban housing.
